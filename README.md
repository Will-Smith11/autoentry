### Abandoned project

The goal of this project was to read pdfs data using ocr from google and then using algorthems create key, pair values of the data on the pdf and then return them in an api.

This currently works about 95% of the time when the pdfs have boxes around the fields. This repo is very messy as I never did any refactoring being abandoning this project
